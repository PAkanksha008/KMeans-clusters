# KMeans-clustering
# project title : Analyisis and prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv of American Mall market called as Phonix Mall to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop.On the basis of this prediction of annual income Vs spending score
# Disclamer:
In this particular dataset we assume annual income as a centriod and spending score from range 1 to 100 data nodes of the clusters.

# Problem Statement :
The american finance Matrket as per the GDP of 2011 'phonix_trillums mall' as in the first range of out of 5.the owner of the mall is wants to be excat which particular shop or product search in different kind of clusters in entire mall.
as the DataScience engineer predict the futuristic financial market for upcomming market GDP rate based on No of clusters.
The client wants atleast top 5 clusters(shops).

# conclusion:
According to the model basis prediction using machine learning alogorithm A,L k-clustering we found that cluster 1 which consist red color bis a highest hes cluster which attach more then 50 data nodes.

# References:
The model building alogrithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values.
The Yellow spots represents centriod which is max to max only 3
